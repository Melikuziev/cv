          When you apply for a software engineer job, it is common for the
          interviewer to say “Tell me about yourself” at the beginning of an
          interview. Hiring managers often ask this question to encourage you to
          introduce yourself and share a short summary of your career.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because this question is one of the first in an interview, it's
          important to answer it successfully. Naturally, by starting the
          interview well, you can make a good impression and set an optimistic
          tone for the rest of the discussion.
        </p>
        <p>
          This question seems relatively simple, it can be challenging for
          candidates to answer effectively. While the question is open-ended,
          employers generally want you to create a brief yet compelling
          narrative that sells you as a candidate. They typically want you to
          discuss your career path, list a few major highlights and end with how
          your professional past has prepared you for the job in question.
